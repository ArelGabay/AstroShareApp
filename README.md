# AstroShareApp - Android Kotlin Project

AstroShareApp is a mobile Android application developed in **Kotlin**, following the **MVVM architecture**, and designed to provide users with a space-themed social platform for sharing astronomical experiences, trip logs, and celestial events. 

This app was built using native Android components and leverages Firebase and local storage for robust functionality and performance.
